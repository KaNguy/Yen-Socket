# Yen Socket
A sufficient-enough implementation of WebSocket which can connect to the gateway and send data. The implementation needs a lot of work and code-cleanup as well.

## Overview
As a basic overview, this implementation is made, so it can interact with gateways and WebSockets, this WebSocket absolutely depends on no non-built-in modules and can mostly achieve sending data.

## Contributing
Contributions are heavily needed for this implementation as there are many bugs with the code, and the implementation needs expanding. Some issues that need fixing is the `MaxListenersExceededWarning` error due to many listeners and a few other issues. You may make a Pull Request if you have an addition or fix to the implementation. Issues are also accepted if it can note what needs change or fixing.
